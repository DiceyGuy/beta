### 🚀 Deployment Steps:

1. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   ```bash
   cd C:\MTGScannerClean
   vercel --prod
   ```

2. **Verify Live Site:**
   - Test card scanning
   - Test edition selector
   - Test payment flow
   - Test collection management

3. **Monitor for Issues:**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify API calls are working
   - Ensure payment redirects work

### 💡 Important Notes:

1. **API Keys:** The Gemini API key is in the code. For production, move to environment variables.

2. **Stripe Integration:** The payment links are hardcoded. Consider creating a backend for dynamic checkout sessions.

3. **Data Storage:** Currently using localStorage. Consider a database for production.

4. **Edition Pricing:** The edition selector now works with real Scryfall data, falling back gracefully when specific editions aren't available.
